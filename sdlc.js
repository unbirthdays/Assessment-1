// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

//QUESTION:
// Implementation
// Design
// Maintain
// Analysis of Requirements
// Testing & Integration
// Planning
//ANSWER (top to bottom):
// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain



//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysisOfRequirements = "This is the second step, in which we think about all of the small features required to fit together into one big product.";
const design = "This is the third step, in which it proves similar to designing the UX of social media. It is how software is changed to best give the end product.";
const implementation = "This is the fourth step, in which it takes the previous three steps and executes them.";
const testingAndIntegration = "This is the fifth step, in which we test software to find out if there's a break in the code.";
const maintain = "This is the last step before rinsing and repeating the others for more features. It involves keeping the code running smoothly.";
